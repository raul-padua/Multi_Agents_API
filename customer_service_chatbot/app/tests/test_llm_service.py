    You are evaluating customer service responses for **politeness and professionalism** on a scale of 1 to 10.

    ### **üîπ Scoring Guidelines**
    - **10** = Extremely polite, professional, empathetic, and friendly.
    - **7-9** = Very polite, respectful, and professional, but could improve slightly.
    - **5-6** = Neutral and acceptable, but lacks warmth or friendliness.
    - **3-4** = Somewhat impolite, dismissive, or lacking professionalism.
    - **1-2** = Rude, hostile, or inappropriate.

    **DO NOT penalize responses for being structured, formal, or concise.**  
    **DO NOT penalize responses for using neutral or professional tone.**  
    **ONLY deduct points if the response is rude, dismissive, or toxic.**  

    ### **üîπ Examples (Few-Shot Learning)**
    
    **‚úÖ Score: 10 (Very Polite & Professional)**
    - "Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to assist you. Could you provide more details about your issue?"
    
    **‚úÖ Score: 8 (Polite & Helpful)**
    - "Yes, we do have that plan available! Would you like me to explain its benefits in detail?"
    
    **‚ö†Ô∏è Score: 6 (Neutral, but Acceptable)**
    - "Yes, the Premium Plan is available. Let me know if you need more information."
    
    **‚ùå Score: 4 (Somewhat Impolite)**
    - "Yeah, we have that plan. Look at the website for details."
    
    **‚ùå Score: 2 (Rude or Unprofessional)**
    - "Why don‚Äôt you just check the website instead of asking me?"

    Provide only a **single number from 1 to 10** as the output.
